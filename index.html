    <h1>The Myth of Data Visualisation</h1>

  <h2>There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics . ____Mark Twain</h2>

      As we all know, data is objective. And Data visualization is one of the most important tools we have to analyze data. However,  it’s just as easy to mislead as it is to educate using charts and graphs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to lie with data visualization. Take this graph as an example.

    <ul>
      <li>This graph shows the changing process of gun deaths in Florida, and 2015 is regarded as an important turning point because of the “stand your guard” law.</li>
      <li>At first glance, it looks like gun deaths are on the decline in recent years. 
But a closer look shows that the y-axis is upside-down, with zero at the top and the maximum value at the bottom. As gun deaths increase, the line slopes downward, violating a well established convention that y-values increase as we move up the page.</li>
      <li>When I check the source of this graph, I found it is from Florida Department of Law Enforcement, whose duties and responsibilities include reducing gun deaths.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>
        To sum up, we can come to a conclusion that the form attempts to propagandize the effect of the “stand your guard” law.

  <h2>How to avoid being misled by this kind of "data lie"? </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Adjust the Y-axis to show the actual development</li>
      <li>Be careful and focus on the data rather than the diagram</li>
    
  </ol>
